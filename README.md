1. Implement pop-up notifications: notifications should be triggered using the notification “constructor” function, which accepts the name, text, and type of notification (success, warning, error).
2. Design a form that, when submitted, displays a notification that the order has been successfully created, as well as three buttons: “Order paid,” “Order shipped,” and “Order received.” Clicking on these buttons displays a notification with the corresponding message.
